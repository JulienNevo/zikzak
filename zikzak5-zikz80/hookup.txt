Desired features
----------------

- VGA out (via microcontroller)
  - text mode
  - minimal graphics mode .. all up to atmega chip; cpu pushes requests to mcu via OUT instructions
- keyboard input
- usb/serial input/output
  - via IN, OUT to atmega

optiona: audio out
--> need to pick audio chip
  -> how do we map it and talk to it? depends on chip .. could OUT port,data and OR-gate to the audio chip
     -- or drive it from mcu, if mcu can spare those moments for updates

optional: cartridge handler
--> with a cart, we can map out the entire ROM to cart, or try to be clever and map cart into
    say 4k-16k ROM space and thus allowing first 4K to offer graphics/text/serial primitives
    to whatever is in cart

IN/OUT Port map
---------------

IN/OUT port 0
  -> in/out: commands to push/pull atmega
IN/OUT port 1
  -> out: video channel (text, say, or perhaps graphics commands?)
  -> in: query framebuffer (?)
IN/OUT port 2
  -> in/out: serial in/out to host PC
IN port 3
  -> in: pull from keyboard (if anything)

OUT port 0 protocol:
Atmega receive:
       Command 0: heartbeat -> keep LED showing another second :P

Interupt map
------------
INT data 0:
    -> keyboard key received

Memory map
----------
0x0000 - 0x03FF -> ROM (16k)
