tests to do:
      - ps2 keyboard from ez80
      - joystick pullups working
      - r2r ladder for extra colours
        - flasg image to cart, show image from cart?

++ cart header definition
   - cart magic (ZZC4R+)?
   - cart unique id identifier (8B string?)
   - z80 mode? ez80 mode?
   - flags?
     - read only or needs write

cart: actually make a cart, and boot code from it .. get toolchain nailed

project: BASIC and add some zz functions
         - https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus
project: SD reader shield/mod .. for big storage, without resorting to giant carts?
project: a big cart eeprom or more likely eprom .. what burner? :/
project: cart zikburner actual dedicated pcb
project: cart .. proto-card cart hacking pcb
project: music or sound player (YM player)
project: nuttX? linux?

bios: add proper time handling (interupt to count time, accurately.. use it in delay-loop functions)
bios: disable/enable framebuffer updates (ie: gpu can keep showing what it has already)
bios: disable rendering entirely (no sync, monitor cuts out)

ez80: BIOS boot menu
      .. show message, hit Del or somethign to go to menu
      .. menu includes the serial/usb cart flasher?
      .. test joy 0/1, keyb, audio, ram, cartrom, serial 0,1, video tests
      .. how to trigger tests on gpu itself, if any? serial on it, during boot as well? test ram, rom, etc bus from gpu..

util: serial/usb -> ez80 cart flasher .. so peopel can flash carts, without needing programmers

audio: make revision with avr for audio, and do emulated SID? makes availability easy.

both: high res text mode (mono, with configurable front/back colour); 640x480 1bpp - double buffered still; sprites?
both: med res textsprite mode - 640x480 4bpp, single frame?
both: sprite-only mode?
both: how to do fast raw framebuffer? delta to know only changed scanlines..b ut full screen upload, how?
      .. disable svreen update, move frame, enable? what sort of framerate can you get then?

ez80: set frame-ready
      gpu: pick up frame ready, and use it to pull sprite/text data .. maybe let cpu run longer if no changes

ez80: autodemo - after timeout and no cart, jump to a demo loop

ez80: memory size determine - write/read/write/read
ez80: memory check
