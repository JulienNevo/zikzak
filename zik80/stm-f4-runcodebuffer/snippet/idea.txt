0) hosting app (bootloader of sorts) sets up a vector table at well defined ram location .. essentially, the list of callable functions
i) objcopy as normal to get the executable chunk
ii) create new file..
    - interupt table the new code wants
    - executable

interupt handlers:
- when host int handler lands, in turn call the interupt handler defined in the cart

cart 'OS calls':
- when cart code wants to call a BIOS function (if any?! :), it can look it up in vector table and call it
--> a standard library, ftw
