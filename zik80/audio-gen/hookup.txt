+5V ****

atmega644
ay-3-8912 (28 pin)

hookups..

basic atmega644 duh.

ay-3-8910:
bottom side:
  pin 3 -> +5V            power
  pin 6 -> GND            power
  pin 5 -> speaker        speaker+ : analog A
  GND -> speaker          speaker-
top side:
pin 28-21 (DA0->DA7) -> avr PA0-7 (top left, left to right same as ay-3-8912)
pin 20 bc1 -> avr PD0
pin 19 bc2 -> +5V (hold high, ignore it)
pin 18 bdir -> avr PD1
pin 17 A8 -> +5V (hold Address A8 high, ignore it)
pin 16 /reset -> +5V (hold high, not reset)
pin 15 clock -> OSCILATOR; currently using 2.5MHz oscilator (4 pin, not crystal)

speaker: using stereo headphone or desktop computer speakers, say (with volume control!)
--> pin base == ground
--> pin tip is left, pin middle is right
(if more slots on pin, they're for mic etc. google)

So .. full top edge of ay-3-8912 is hooked up, buttom edge is just power and a speaker like

TBD:
- analog channel B and C
- analog A, B, C -> mixer? ADC into avr again and then back out PWM to speaker mixed?
  - or can ay-3-8910 do its own mixing A B C -> A?
