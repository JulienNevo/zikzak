Zok r1 pcb as base

mcu: atmega644

ftdi FT232RL is populated, and USB port is used for power; given zok base, PD0/1 can be toggled on/off as serial
to ftdi, so lets test that serial port.

LED on PD6, for blinkenlights sign of life

20mhz crystal on zok for mcu .. is currentl not in use; fuses are set to internal 8mhz oscilator, so
the F_CPU in main.h is set to correspond, so the baudrate calculations work.
